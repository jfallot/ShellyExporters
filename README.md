# ShellyExporters
All Shelly Exporters for Prometheus that I have written.

This is a repository where I keep all my Shelly Exporters and make them available for others that look for them.
Other implementations were quite old and/or didn't give enough flexibility so I made my own in C#.

Each exporter is available as a docker container

## Exporter Requests

If you would like me to write more exporters for more Shelly devices I am happy to do so when I have some spare time.  
You may also create a pull request if you can do it yourself and understand the architecture that I am trying to maintain.

For me to write another exporter I will need:
- Access to the device for testing - Open a new issue so it can ba arranged
- A few weeks of time - I may not have much free time and testing exporters takes a lot of time
