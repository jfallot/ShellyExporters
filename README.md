# ShellyExporters
All Shelly Exporters for Prometheus that I have written.

This is a repository where I keep all my Shelly Exporters and make them available for others that look for them.
Other implementations were quite old and/or didn't give enough flexibility so I made my own in C#.

Each exporter is available as a docker container with documentation on the wiki:
